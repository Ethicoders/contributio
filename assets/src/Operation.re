    From there, bind a Version Constrol System platform account such as GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket,...
    Your account is now fully setup!
    A note for what comes next: you don't have to choose between being a Maintainer or a Contributor. You can freely import your own repositories and work on other people's."

      From your account, go to 'Import' and choose an origin. You'll get a list of repositories you may want to import as Contributio projects.
      Pick the repositories, import them and voilÃ ! You now have tracked projects and related issues will be automatically imported when created.

      Even if your submission isn't validated, you'll get a portion of the experience when it is closed, as Contributio considers that any work provided should be rewarded."
